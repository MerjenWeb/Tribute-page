                <li><b>1914</b> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
                <li><b>1933</b> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a
                    Depression
                    era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
                <li><b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation
                    Corps,
                    helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on
                    me."
                </li>
                <li><b>1937</b> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service
                </li>
                <li><b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts.
                    Inspired by
                    Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
                    pest-resistent plants.</li>
                <li><b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected.
                    Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
                    disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
                <li><b>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology
                </li>
                <li><b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and
                    flies
                    to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
                    different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major
                    climate
                    on Earth.</li>
                <li><b>1945</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed,
                    creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
                </li>
                <li><b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed,
                    creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
                </li>
                <li><b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian
                    subcontinent
                    in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>
                <li><b>1970</b> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
                <li><b>1983</b> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields
                </li>
                <li><b>1984</b> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
                <li><b>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that
                    genetically
                    modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that
                    GM
                    crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals
                    for
                    a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
                <li><b>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
